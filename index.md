# Titan Jewellery Business Case Study: Pricing Trends, Seasonal Demand & Competitive Insights

[“I worked on a case study analyzing Titan’s jewellery business. I combined Titan’s financial reports, gold/diamond prices, and seasonal festival/wedding data to study demand patterns. I built dashboards in Power BI and ran correlation/forecasting models in Python. I also benchmarked Titan against competitors like Kalyan and Malabar. The project highlights both my data skills and my ability to extract business insights.” **(README pitch)**]
